### Recommendation to Sumera
Implementing a data pipeline/warehouse and optimizing data refresh processes would significantly reduce the time required to update the dashboard with new weekly data. This would improve efficiency and ensure timely availability of insights for decision-making. Additionally, sticking with Power BI would provide us with the necessary visualization capabilities and scalability for our business needs.
